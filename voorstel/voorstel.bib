  abstract    = {The mobile apps have been reaching a huge success on the mobile market. This opportunity attracted a lot of interested companies to have their own optimized mobile apps for all major mobile operation systems. However, these developments are expensive when developed natively for each mobile platform. New improvements done on the web technologies, allowed more features and capabilities than previously was only possible on apps that was developed natively. This started new possibilities on consolidate all developments only on web apps, that are apps that runs on web browsers. This paper intends to understand which evolutions, capabilities and limitations exists on developing a web app to run in all devices. We present the new concept of Progressive Web App, created by Google, in a way to normalize all web developments. It will be introduced the major advantages on developing the apps centralized as a Progressive Web App, comparing on developing the same solution for each different mobile platform. It will be also described the current state of web technologies and in which preferable scenarios the Progressive Web Apps are a strong alternative to the mobile native apps.},

While Web apps traditionally did not properly function without an Internet connection, PWAs enable them to be downloaded, installed and used offline on various systems, including mobile devices and personal computers. We present an introduction to the state-of-art in research and practice. Based on this, we discuss various underlying concepts and technologies. Then, we scrutinize and compare PWAs against cross-platform app development approaches on both technical and overarching aspects. A list of suggestions for future research is also presented. We urge academia to keep up with the latest trends within the field of mobile and web development, as new concepts and approaches such as Progressive Web Apps now make for interesting research topics with tangible real-world effects.},

  url       = {https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2623330.2623705},
  abstract  = {With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices, the number of mobile Apps available has exploded over the past few years. To facilitate the choice of mobile Apps, existing mobile App recommender systems typically recommend popular mobile Apps to mobile users. However, mobile Apps are highly varied and often poorly understood, particularly for their activities and functions related to privacy and security. Therefore, more and more mobile users are reluctant to adopt mobile Apps due to the risk of privacy invasion and other security concerns. To fill this crucial void, in this paper, we propose to develop a mobile App recommender system with privacy and security awareness. The design goal is to equip the recommender system with the functionality which allows to automatically detect and evaluate the security risk of mobile Apps. Then, the recommender system can provide App recommendations by considering both the Apps' popularity and the users' security preferences. Specifically, a mobile App can lead to security risk because insecure data access permissions have been implemented in this App. Therefore, we first develop the techniques to automatically detect the potential security risk for each mobile App by exploiting the requested permissions. Then, we propose a flexible approach based on modern portfolio theory for recommending Apps by striking a balance between the Apps' popularity and the users' security concerns, and build an App hash tree to efficiently recommend Apps. Finally, we evaluate our approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale data set collected from Google Play. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract  = {Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are widely used for personal and business purposes. A mobile device may carry sensitive data and becomes an easy target for cyber criminals. Mobile security is thus important. Mobile security testing targets to detect vulnerabilities and malicious apps on a mobile device. In this paper, we present four testing approaches for mobile security: mobile forensic, penetration test, static analysis, and dynamic analysis. A mobile security testing network is further demonstrated in the paper to evaluate the effectiveness of the four testing approaches. Our testing results indicate that mobile security testing tools are still in their early development stages and efforts are desired to improve these tools. We conclude the paper with a summary of mobile security testing challenges and future directions.},

  abstract  = {Communicating mobile security threats and best practices has become a central objective due to the ongoing discovery of new vulnerabilities of mobile devices. To cope with this overarching issue, the goal of this paper is to identify and analyze existing threats and best practices in the domain of mobile security. To this extent, we conducted a literature review based on a set of keywords. The obtained results concern recognizable threats and established best practices in the domain of mobile security. Afterwards, this outcome was put forward for consideration by mobile application users (n = 167) via a survey instrument. To this end, the results show high awareness of the threats and their countermeasures in the domain of mobile applications. While recognizing the risks associated with physical and social factors, the majority of respondents declared the use of built-in methods to mitigate the negative impact of malicious software and social-engineering scams. The study results contribute to the theory on mobile security through the identification and exploration of a variety of issues, regarding both threats and best practices. Besides this, this bulk of up-to-date knowledge has practical value which reflects in its applicability at both the individual and enterprise level. Moreover, at this point, we argue that understanding the factors affecting users’ intentions and motivations to accept and use particular technologies is crucial to leverage the security of mobile applications. Therefore, future work will cover identifying and modeling users’ perceptions of the security and usability of mobile applications.},
